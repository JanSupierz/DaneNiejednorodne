# Accelerating Pure KNN with FCM Clustering

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate that the traditional **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm - while quite accurate - can be optimized using a hybrid approach combining **Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)** clustering and **data grouping**. The goal is to preserve or improve classification performance while reducing computational time.

## Key Results

<!-- Replace `images/result1.png` with your actual path -->

![KNN_Bar](images/knnbar.png "TEST")

Pure KNN method had quite consistent results across the board, almost always over 1.5 seconds.

![Data_fixed](images/fixedata_knn.png)

Using KNN as a baseline, the data is correctly processed and refined.

![FCM_times](images/fcmknn_time.png)

When using FCM, the processing times varied significantly depending on the number of clusters and the value of *k* in KNN.

![FCM_Full](images/manyclusters.png)

A high cluster count often leads to inflated results that fail to represent the practical effectiveness of the FCM+KNN approach.

![FCM_Small](images/smallclusters.png)

Reducing the number of clusters yields results that are much more in line with the desired outcomes, highlighting the method's potential.

![valid_small](images/validation.png)

These results demonstrate that the optimized method can either slighly or drastically reduce computation time while maintaining classification accuracy.

![Quality](images/result_quality.png)

This graph shows that while the FCM-based method is noticeably faster, its decision-making is only slightly less accurate when handling amended values. On average, it also tends to make fewer severe errors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- common libraries, installed via **JupyterNotebook**

## Setup

#### Setup (Windows)

Extract downloaded source code into a *desired location*.

Create a **Python virtual environment** in the extracted folder:

```powershell
python -m venv .\.venv
```

Open `.ipynb` file (being the Jupyter Notebook) and press **Run All**.

#### Setup (Linux_64-Debian)

Extract downloaded source code into a *desired location*.

Create a **Python virtual environment** in the extracted folder:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Open `.ipynb` file (being the Jupyter Notebook) and press **Run All**.

## Troubleshoot

If your Jupiter environment of choice (which might be e.g. <u>VSCode</u>) does not activate `.venv` automatically, you might need to execute one of these commands inside the project folder:

| System    | Command                     |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Windows   | ..venv\Scripts\activate.bat |
| Linuxs_64 | source .venv/bin/activate   |
